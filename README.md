# TFG
React app using Riot API with Spring backend

In order to run this app you need to run all 3 apps at the same time (Mysql, React & Java)

React app needs some libraries to run correctly:
  - ReactRouter
  - ReactPlayer
  - AntDesign

The Java app runs with Spring.
Your will need to run a MySQL server to store all the data from the game, I used XAMPP to run my DB locally. In the MYSQL folder you can find my tables and data.
